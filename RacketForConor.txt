;;Bank loan with interest with time until the amount is paid fully paid

(define function (lambda ( amount interest deduction) (if (< amount 0) #t #f)))
(define monthly (lambda (X)(expt (* (/ X 100) 1 )(/ 1 12))))
;i need to make  a line for when the money should be given eg. begining of the month or the end of the month.............
;i also have a problem where my intresrt never ends and increases by 6 euro:

(define newvalue( lambda (loan interest payment) ( * (- loan payment) interest)))
(define time (lambda (loan interest payment) (if ( > (newvalue loan interest payment) loan) "You will not pay off your loan with that amount of payment"
                                                 (if (<= (- loan payment) 0) 1 (+ (time (newvalue loan interest payment) interest payment) 1)))))

; My list of data:
(define loans '(1000 100 155522 'Error 1+5i 500000));the 3 list contain malform data
(define rates '(1.06 1.03 1.02 'NotRate 1.075))
(define payment '(100 2.5 3200 37500 -5))

(define Loans (filter integer? loans))
(define Rates (filter real? rates))
(define Payment (filter positive? payment))

(map time Loans Rates Payment);it takes  all the 3 lists first element in the coresponding element a nd tells how many months it will take to pay it off
